# 🤖 Vision Model for Document Extraction API

This repository contains a robust, layout-aware document processing and field extraction API built using Flask, Google Cloud Vision OCR, LayoutParser, and the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for structured data extraction.

It is specifically optimized for extracting key information from engineering forms, invoices, and checklists, leveraging hybrid techniques (Vision OCR + layout segmentation + deterministic regex pre-extraction + LLM-based reasoning).

## ✨ Key Features
Layout-aware OCR, enhanced preprocessing, Google Vision integration, Gemini-based field extraction, Flask API, and Ngrok support.

## 🛠️ Setup
Refer to the README content previously provided for full setup, configuration, and API usage.
